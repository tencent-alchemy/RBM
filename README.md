# RBM
The simulator for quantum RBM algorithm

Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a powerful wavefunction ansatz to
describe the quantum many-body systems. RBM based hybrid quantum algorithm can
efficiently model spin systems and Fermionic systems. This RBM repository
provides an instance of implementation and relevant tools to develop the quantum
RBM algorithms.
